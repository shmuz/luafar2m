$ #LuaFAR History (version 3.12.2) - Help Contents -#
 #LuaFAR History# is a plugin for displaying histories of commands,
folders, and viewed/edited files.

 When a history list is displayed, its items can be filtered by filtering
patterns entered from the keyboard. The pattern is displayed in the window
title. There are 4 switchable filtering methods available:

 - DOS patterns (#*# and #?#)
 - Lua patterns
 - FAR regular expressions
 - Plain text
